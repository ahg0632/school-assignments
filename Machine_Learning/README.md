# Machine Learning

## Purpose
Each of these assignments explores the fundamentals of Machine Learning alogorithms and their applications on various types of problems from text recognition to image categorizing to predictions on tabular models.

## Usage
Each assignment has been completed and by simply opening the file the contents can be viewed with reports attached.

## Run
To run the jupyter files , `.ipynb`, an IDE like VSCode or Jupyter would work. If you have another IDE that supports the file then it can be used as well.

**Important**
Use an VM to run python code to avoid bloating computer with python packages. For these assignments `Anaconda` was used. Any other preferred VM can be used.

### Steps
- Download VM of choice and create an instance
- Switch to the VM and begin installing packages that which will be in each jupyter file
- Begin running the code - block by block
- Once completed exit the VM and either delete it or keep it for future use

## Additional Info
The `ML_Project` file is the final for the class and was a project of our choosing using the methods learned in class while also having the freedom to use other algorithms in the field
