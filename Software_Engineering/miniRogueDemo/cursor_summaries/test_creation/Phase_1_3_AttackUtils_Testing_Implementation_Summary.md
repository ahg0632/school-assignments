# Phase 1.3 AttackUtils Testing Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 1.3 focused on implementing comprehensive tests for the `AttackUtils` class, which provides swing-based attack mechanics and hit detection for both players and enemies. This phase was critical for validating the core combat system's utility functions that handle attack visual data, swing timing, and hit detection logic.

- **Boss-Specific Mechanics**: Validate boss size and range modifiers
- **Multi-Class Support**: Test different character classes (Warrior, Mage)
- **Performance and Timing**: Ensure attack operations complete efficiently
- **Mathematical Calculations**: Validate angle calculations, fan width, and positioning

### Key Components Tested
1. **AttackVisualData Class**: Data transfer object for attack visual information
