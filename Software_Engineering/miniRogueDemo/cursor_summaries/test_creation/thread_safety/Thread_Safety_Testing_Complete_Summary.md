## **Project Overview**

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the thread safety testing implementation completed for the Mini Rogue Demo project. The testing was conducted systematically across multiple phases to ensure the application remains stable and performant under concurrent access scenarios.

## **Testing Strategy Overview**
