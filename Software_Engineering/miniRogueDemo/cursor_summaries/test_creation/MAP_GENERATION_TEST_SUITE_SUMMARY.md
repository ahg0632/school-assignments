- **Comprehensive Testing**: Combined coverage of both functional and non-functional requirements
- **Consistent Patterns**: Uses same testing patterns and conventions as existing tests
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Leverages existing test utilities and configurations

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions

2. **Memory Testing**: Add memory leak detection for large map operations
3. **Stress Testing**: Add tests for very large maps or extreme entity counts
4. **Integration Testing**: Add tests for map interaction with game logic

### Maintenance Considerations
1. **Test Data Updates**: Update test data if game constants change
2. **New Tile Types**: Add tests for any new tile types added to the system
3. **Entity Type Updates**: Update tests when new entity types are added
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor test execution times for performance regressions

## Conclusion

The map generation test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the map system's core functionality, ensuring:

- **Reliability**: All map generation operations work correctly
