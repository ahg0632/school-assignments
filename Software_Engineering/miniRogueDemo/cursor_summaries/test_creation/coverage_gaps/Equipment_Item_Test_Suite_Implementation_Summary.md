## Test Architecture

### 🏗️ **Test Structure**
- **Nested Test Classes**: Organized by functionality (Creation, Usage, Validation, etc.)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Each test class covers 8-10 different aspects
- **Edge Case Testing**: Zero values, negative values, null inputs, boundary conditions
- **Mock Usage**: Proper mocking for Character and Player interactions

### 📋 **Test Categories**
1. **Creation Tests**: Object instantiation with various parameters
2. **Property Tests**: Getter methods and property validation
3. **Usage Tests**: Method calls and interaction testing
4. **Validation Tests**: Class compatibility and business logic
5. **Edge Case Tests**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios
6. **String Representation Tests**: toString() method validation

## Technical Implementation

### 🔧 **Test Framework**
- **JUnit 5**: Latest testing framework with nested test support
- **Mockito**: Mocking framework for character interactions
- **Nested Tests**: Organized test structure for better readability
- **Comprehensive Assertions**: Multiple assertion types for thorough validation

### 🎯 **Testing Patterns**
- **Setup/Teardown**: Proper test initialization with @BeforeEach
- **Mock Objects**: Character and Player mocking for isolated testing

- **Validation**: Both positive and negative test cases

## Current Issues

### ⚠️ **Mockito Compatibility**
- **Issue**: Mockito ByteBuddy compatibility with Java 24
- **Error**: "Java 24 (68) is not supported by the current version of Byte Buddy"
- **Impact**: Tests cannot run due to mocking framework limitations
- **Solution**: Update Mockito/ByteBuddy versions or use Java 20 for testing

### 🔧 **Recommended Solutions**
1. **Update Dependencies**: Upgrade Mockito to latest version supporting Java 24
2. **Alternative Testing**: Use real objects instead of mocks where possible
3. **Java Version**: Use Java 20 for testing environment
4. **VM Property**: Set `net.bytebuddy.experimental` as VM property
