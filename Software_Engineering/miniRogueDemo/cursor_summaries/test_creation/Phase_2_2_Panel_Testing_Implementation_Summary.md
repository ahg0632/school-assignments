- **Coverage**: Tests cover both happy path and edge cases

### **Key Testing Patterns**
1. **State Verification**: Check initial state, perform action, verify final state
2. **Exception Safety**: Use `assertDoesNotThrow()` for methods that may have complex conditions
3. **Performance Testing**: Measure execution time for panel operations
4. **Component Integration**: Test how different panel components work together

### **Panel Systems Tested**
- **Equipment Management**: Equipment display, stats, interaction, visualization
- **Inventory Management**: Item display, selection, usage, grouping
- **Menu Navigation**: State management, option selection, transitions
- **Event Handling**: Mouse and keyboard event processing
- **Performance**: Panel operation timing and efficiency
- **Component Management**: Focus, visibility, and state management

## **Critical Issues Encountered and Resolved**

### **1. Panel-Specific Interface Requirements**
**Issue**: Each panel has unique interface requirements and dependencies
- **Root Cause**: Different panels have different constructor signatures and method requirements
- **Fix**: Created panel-specific mock implementations for GameView and GameController
- **Files Modified**: `EquipmentPanelTest.java`, `SideInventoryPanelTest.java`

### **2. Equipment Panel Constructor Parameters**
**Issue**: EquipmentPanel constructor expects specific parameters
- **Root Cause**: EquipmentPanel has different initialization requirements than other panels
- **Fix**: Updated mock GameView to provide correct panel references
- **Files Modified**: `EquipmentPanelTest.java`

### **3. SideInventoryPanel Method Signatures**
**Issue**: SideInventoryPanel has unique method signatures for item management
- **Root Cause**: SideInventoryPanel uses different item setting methods than expected
- **Fix**: Updated tests to use correct method signatures (`setItems()` instead of `set_player()`)
- **Files Modified**: `SideInventoryPanelTest.java`

### **4. Mock Implementation Complexity**
**Issue**: Complex mock implementations for panel-specific functionality
- **Root Cause**: Panels have many interface methods that need mocking
- **Fix**: Created comprehensive mock implementations with all required methods
- **Files Modified**: `EquipmentPanelTest.java`, `SideInventoryPanelTest.java`

### **5. Panel-Specific Event Handling**
**Issue**: Different panels handle events differently
- **Root Cause**: Each panel has unique event handling requirements
- **Fix**: Created panel-specific event handling tests
- **Files Modified**: `EquipmentPanelTest.java`, `SideInventoryPanelTest.java`
