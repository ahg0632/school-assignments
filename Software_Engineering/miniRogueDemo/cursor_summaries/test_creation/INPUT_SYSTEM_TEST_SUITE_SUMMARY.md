## MVC Architecture Compliance

### Model-View-Controller Separation

**Model Layer:**
- Tests verify that input components don't directly modify game state
- Input state is properly encapsulated within input components
- Dependencies are injected rather than directly referenced

**View Layer:**
- Tests ensure input handlers only process events and update input state
- No direct manipulation of view components from input handlers
- Input events are properly delegated to controllers

**Controller Layer:**
- Tests verify that InputManager coordinates between input handlers and game components
- Proper delegation of input events to game logic
- Clean separation of input processing from game state management

### Observer Pattern Implementation

**Loose Coupling:**
- Tests verify that input components use observer patterns for communication
- No direct dependencies between input handlers and game components
- Input state changes are properly notified to observers

## Test Design Principles

### Simple Solutions Approach

1. **Minimal Complexity:** Tests focus on essential functionality without over-engineering
2. **Clear Test Names:** Each test method has a descriptive name indicating its purpose
3. **Focused Testing:** Each test method tests one specific aspect of functionality
4. **Readable Assertions:** Clear assertion messages that explain expected behavior

### School Project Appropriateness

1. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests cover all major input functionality
2. **Educational Value:** Tests demonstrate proper testing practices
3. **Maintainable Code:** Well-structured tests that are easy to understand and modify
4. **Realistic Scenarios:** Tests reflect actual usage patterns of the input system

## Test Execution Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Individual component testing with isolated dependencies
- Mock objects used where appropriate to isolate units under test
- Fast execution for rapid feedback during development

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end testing of input system components
- Real component interactions tested
- Comprehensive coverage of input flow scenarios

### Thread Safety Tests
- Concurrent access testing to ensure thread safety
- Deadlock prevention verification
- Performance testing under concurrent load

### Edge Case Coverage
- **Null Input:** All components tested for null event handling
- **Invalid Input:** Invalid key codes and mouse events tested
- **Missing Dependencies:** Tests for robustness when components are missing
- **Concurrent Access:** Thread safety verified under concurrent load

### Error Handling Coverage

- Dependencies are properly injected and configured

**Test Isolation:**
- Tests don't interfere with each other
- State is properly reset between tests
- No shared mutable state between test methods
