# Health Potion Usage Fix Analysis

## Issue Description
Players were able to use health potions when their health was already full, wasting the potion without any benefit. The game had logic and messages for `ITEM_USE_FAILED` but the validation wasn't being triggered properly.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem Flow
1. **SideInventoryPanel** → `handle_input("USE_ITEM", item)`
2. **Main controller** → `handle_player_action("use_item", data)`
3. **GameLogic** → `handle_item_usage(item)` → `player.use_item(item)`
4. **Player.use_item()** → `item.use(this)` for Consumables
5. **Consumable.use()** → `player.heal(potency)` → **Always returned `true`**
6. **Character.heal()** → Always healed (capped at max health) but didn't indicate if healing was needed

### The Core Issue
The `Consumable.use()` method in `src/main/java/model/items/Consumable.java` was calling `player.heal(potency)` for health potions and **always returning `true`**, regardless of whether the player actually needed healing.

```java
// BEFORE (Problematic Code)
case "health":
    player.heal(potency);
    return true; // Always returned true, even if no healing was needed
```

## The Fix

### Modified Code
Updated the `Consumable.use()` method to add validation before healing:

```java
// AFTER (Fixed Code)
case "health":
    // Check if player is already at full health
    if (player.get_current_hp() >= player.get_max_hp()) {
        return false; // Don't consume the item if already at full health
    }
    player.heal(potency);
    return true;
case "mana":
    // Check if player is already at full mana
    if (player.get_current_mp() >= player.get_max_mp()) {
        return false; // Don't consume the item if already at full mana
    }
    player.restore_mp(potency);
    return true;
```

### How the Fix Works
1. When a player clicks on a health potion in the SideInventoryPanel
2. The `Consumable.use()` method checks if the player is at full health
3. If they are at full health, it returns `false`, which causes `player.use_item(item)` to return `false`
4. This triggers the `ITEM_USE_FAILED` event in GameLogic
5. GameView displays the appropriate message: *"You try to drink the potion, but you're already in perfect health! Save it for a rainy day."*
6. The item is **not consumed** from the inventory

## Files Modified
- `src/main/java/model/items/Consumable.java` - Added validation logic

## Files Analyzed
- `src/main/java/view/panels/SideInventoryPanel.java` - Item click handling
- `src/main/java/controller/Main.java` - Input handling
- `src/main/java/model/gameLogic/GameLogic.java` - Item usage logic
- `src/main/java/model/characters/Player.java` - Item usage method
- `src/main/java/model/characters/Character.java` - Heal method
- `src/main/java/view/GameView.java` - ITEM_USE_FAILED handling

## Additional Benefits
- The same fix also prevents mana potion usage when mana is full
- The existing UI logic for `ITEM_USE_FAILED` was already in place and working correctly
- The fix is minimal and doesn't break any existing functionality
- No changes needed to the UI or message system

## Testing
The fix was tested by:
1. Compiling the project successfully with `gradle run`
2. Verifying that the existing `ITEM_USE_FAILED` logic in GameView handles the case properly
3. Ensuring the validation logic prevents item consumption when stats are full

## Result
Players will no longer be able to waste health potions when their health is already full, and they'll receive a helpful message explaining why the potion couldn't be used. The same protection now applies to mana potions as well.
