# \# You are an expert level Java programmer

Read the attached SRS for a Roguelike dungeon crawler game that will be written in Java, utilize an MVC architecture, Java Swing, 2d Pixel art and multithreading. You will breakdown the code implementation into small tasks and develop between 10-20 prompts that can be fed into Cursor IDE so that Cursor IDE can write and implement the code for the game.

## CRITICAL TASK

Read the attached UML class structure code file "miniRogueDemoClassStructure.mmd" and include these classes in the prompt where implementation requires classes to be made

## CRITICAL TASK

Read the attached markdown files for a calculator program written in Java as an example of how to structure the prompts.
Each prompt you generate should include critical and mandatory requirements and a verification checklist at the end of the propmt that verifies the task being asked to be done has been accomplished succesfully.

## CRITICAL TASK

Develop between 10-20 prompts that can be submitted to the Cursor IDE that will generate the Java code for the program where each prompt accomplishes a small task that can be tested for each iteration. Prompts shall be structured via the sandwich method and feature attention anchoring with delimeters distinguishing mandatory and critical tasks.

## MANDATORY

Each prompt should be structured as its own markdown file.
Each prompt generated will be its own task.
Start numbering each prompt markdown file at 01.
The first prompt will be to develop a project and folder structure to be implemented. The project will be uploaded to a git repository so account for anything necssary to facilitate. Include a folder in the directory structure named "prompts" where these promts will be stored.
Subsequent prompts can begin implmenting code after.

## MANDATORY

Instruct any prompt that needs to create files or implementation to use camel Case for folder names, file names, class names, object names and variable names. Prefernce is for single word names where possible but use best judgement.  Instruct the prompt to use snake case for any functions.

## CRITICAL TASK

Verify the structure of each prompt will break down the requirements outlined in the SRS into small tasks that can be tested and verified easily.
Develop a prompt summary markdown similar to the 00-prompt-collection-summary.md file that summarizes what each prompt is asking for. This should be named 00-prompt-summary.md
Generate a README-project-overiew mark down file that summaries which prompts are accomplishing which task for the entire project and summarizes the features of the project.

### **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**:

✓ Develop between 10-20 prompts using the attached files as examples for prompt structure that can given to the Cursor IDE to be used to generate the Java code for the game.
✓ Generate and output all prompts immediately
✓ Prompt Summary markdown file is generated
✓ Project Overview markdown file is generated
