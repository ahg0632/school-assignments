# Networking Socket in C++

This assigment is to create a UDP/TCP socket locally to send an image. The purpose is to simulate what happens over the internet when packets are sent and how multiple packets come together to form a single message.

## HOW TO USE:

### TCP
- Navigate to each folder in the `TCP_SOCKET` folder and run the executable file starting with the `TCP_Server` then the `TCP_Client`
- The concsole will prompt to enter the name of the image
- Ensure the image is correctly spelled (case sensitive) and make sure the image exists in the same directory as the `TCP_Client`
- Otherwise type the path entirely in the console where the image lies Ex. (`C:\Users\Default\Desktop\image.jpg`)
- The image will be saved in the same file as the server executable and it is hard coded as a jpg

### UDP 
navigate to each folder in the `UDP_SOCKET` folder and run the executable file starting with the `UDP_Server` then the `UDP_Client`
- The concsole will prompt to enter the name of the image
- Ensure the image is correctly spelled (case sensitive) and make sure the image exists in the same directory as the `UDP_Client`
- Otherwise type the path entirely in the console where the image lies Ex. (`C:\Users\Default\Desktop\image.jpg`)
- The image will be saved in the same file as the server executable and it is hard coded as a jpg
